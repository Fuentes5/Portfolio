#predict next 8 Quarter using ausbeer
  #a) Evaluate the adequacy of the 3 na√Øve models, on the training set.
  #b) Which method are you going to apply for prediction? Use RMSE.
  #c) Provide the values of point forecasts. Graph the original time series, fitted values, as well as the point predictions
  #and confidence intervals.
