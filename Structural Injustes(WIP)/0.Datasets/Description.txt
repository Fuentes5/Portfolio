This course provides a survey of current quantitative methods for analyzing structural disparities.
Using philosophies from interdisciplinary fields, we follow examples from education, housing, and
other topics to document the direction and size of social and economic disparities. The course
begins with a discussion on the philosophies of major data issues. We then learn to analyze
disparities using a wide range of data types – spatial, experimental, and observational – through
the use of raw, real-world data sets. Discussions will center on biases resulting from data, models,
and algorithms. The course uses R and QGIS. Prior to enrolling, students should have a foundation
in regression analysis
