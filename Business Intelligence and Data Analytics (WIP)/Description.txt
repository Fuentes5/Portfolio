Business Intelligence and Data Analytics (BIDA)
This course is about how organizations, and their employees can successfully collect, evaluate and apply
information to become better decision makers. It starts with basic concepts regarding business data needs
and ends with hands-on experience using Business Intelligence (BI) tools. It takes a variety of experts to
start and run a business - financial, operational, marketing, accounting, human relations, managerial, etc.
Each knowledge base requires up-to-date information to plot strategy or keep it on track. Our ability to
capture large volumes of data often outstrips our ability to evaluate and apply the data as management
information. These are the challenges we will address in this course so that you can become an intelligent
gatherer and user of data in your chosen field.
